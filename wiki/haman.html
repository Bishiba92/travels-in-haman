			For a long period of time Haman were divided by several kingdoms. These kingdoms were not warring, 
			despite their cultural aversion to violence. Instead they dealt in trade but the rule of law varied greatly between them.
			They have resisted several invasions during the centuries, a true iron wall against the outside world. 
			But it was one of the great kings from Haman that managed to create this isolated paradise.
			<p>
			
			This great king's name was Har'gaz of the name Gazy.
			<p>
			It was in the year 250 AMO(After Magi Ordinance) that Har'gaz realized the great threat the Magi order posed to his and the other kingdoms of Haman. 
			He then started his grand endeavour to unite all the lords of Haman to create one of the most fierce armies in the world. 
			<p>
			This was proven to be a task that was far more difficult than he'd imagine.
			This was due to the fact that no other king was willing to forfeit their rule to him or anyone else. 
			Firstly due to honor and secondly - <i>unsurprisingly</i> - due to human desire for power.
			<p>
			It was at first troubling, mainly because it did hinder him in his progress. He himself was also not willing to give up his own power.
			He had to come up with some new way of tackling the issue. He knew war was no option, he needed every lord in all of Haman to be strong.
			<p>
			In the end he did something fairly surprising, he took the ideas of his potential foes to the east and made it his own.
			He thought that maybe an empire would work well in Haman. He knew the empire was the cause of the issues to the east, but the circumstances
			of the Magi order empire are far different from those of Haman. 
			<p>
			The regions of Haman have their own identies and they do not want to forfeit them, the kings do not want to lose their power or be less than any other king.
			Turning the kings to lords would only cause eventual havoc, especially if conquered.
			<p>
			So he requested another summoning to all the kings.
			<p>
			The following is drawn directly from Har'gaz' wife's journal and other's in attendence at the hall of Heroes this day.
			<p>
			<div class="spoiler"><i>(Haman's proposal was...</i>
				<input class="wikiButtons" type="button" onclick="showSpoiler(this, 'div');" value="Show" />
				<div class="inner" style="display:none;">
					...that all the kings of Haman unite under a unified banner of peace, prosperity and defense against foreign invasion. 
					There was an uproar in the hall of Heroes 
					- "He is suggesting the same thing once again!", King Ulvain yelled out in contempt.
					- "A travesty, I travelled all the way from Mirron for this?!", King Asmodiin cried out.
					<p>
					Many a voices yelled out against Har'gaz proposal. But Har'gaz stood silent, knowing the kings have misunderstood his concept.
					Once the kings saw he did not faulter in his stance at the center, their voices lowered and Har'gaz continued his proposal.
					<p>
					- "I understand you are confused about my proposal, I am not surprised. I suggest to you all something that sounds far too familiar to be worthy
					of a gathering yet again.", Har'gaz was walking slowly at the center, gazing all around him at the kings.
					<p>
					- "However! You have misunderstood my intent on this day. I have NO desire to rule you, nor that any other man shall take rule of me!", Har'gaz exlaimed
					with a great deal of fortitude. His deep voice silencing any whisper that would dare speak up in the hall.
					<p>
					Har'gaz stopped for a moment, to ensure the kings were paying attention and to temper his voice. He then stated with a deep and wise voice;
					- "It is clear to me what has to be done, the order to the east will not stop their conquest, their eyes WILL turn toward Haman and it occur happen before long.
					And we must decide to unite."
					<p>
					Upon uttering the worde unite, he could see that Ulvain started to bubble. Ulvain was sure to explode. Just as Ulvain was about to raise up and exclaim something
					in anger Har'gaz rose his hand toward him, not in the way a guard would stop an uninvited guest or how you'd desire to truly silence someone, no his hand said to 
					Ulvain only one this, "Wait, just let me finish.". As if by a miracle this worked, Ulvain gathered himself and continued to await Har'gaz' proposal.
					<p>
					Har'gaz nods slightly to Ulvain and continues;
					- "On this day, I am not proposing that we become a kingdom. I would rather call it an empire, an empire of Haman."
					<p>
					He looked around the hall, he was expecting an outburst. But no outburst was to be found, the kings were silent, listening.
					<p>	
					
					<div class="spoiler"><i>(It is important to understand...</i>
					<input class="wikiButtons" type="button" onclick="showSpoiler(this, 'span');" value="Show"/>
						<span class="inner" style="display:none;">			
								 ...that the kings of Haman had these gatherings often, but rarely were they calm. The outburst that Haman had to tackle with just before
								 was something he expected he had to deal with several times during his proposal. But something was different. And an excerpt from a diary that was written by Asmodiin
								 points to a potential reason.
								 "... I could not understand it, no one cried out to contest. Not when Har'gaz uttered the word 'unite' nor when he went on to suggest an empire ... The only thing
								 I can imagine as a reasonable explanation for this is that every king had the same thoughts as I did myself - The magi order will come and we do not stand a chance."
								- Asmodiin, 264 AMO.
							It does seem as if all the kings of Haman feared the same outcome and due to their logic and their prowess in combat they were well aware of the danger. 
							They must've been hopeful that some solution would appear where they would still perservere with power in hand.).

					<p>
					<p>
					Har'gaz was stunned, yet he didn't show it. The only thing that could be noticed was that he did not quickly continue his speech, he was clearly ready for the disgruntlement
					of the other kings. However, he must've noticed something in Ulvain as he raised his hand toward Ulvain, prompting Ulvain to stand up and ask a simple question.
					<p>
					Ulvain, as he stood up looked a bit confused as this was rather unexpected. He, who normally was so powerful in his behaviour, was now a bit staggered. He quickly mustered
					himself and was as stoic as always. Then his question was announced;
					- "I am struck with confusion Har'gaz... You suggest an empire, like the one to the east? Then we would be nothing more than puppets to whoever among us would be the emperor.".
					<p>
					A quiet mumble was heard throughout the crowd of kings.
					<p>
					Har'gaz nodded and said;
					- "Your question is very warranted. I understand the confusion and I have no doubt everyone here is worried about what an empire would lead to in the long run. Yet, I am quite
					unsure... about what to call it. Perhaps an empire is not even the word for what I have in mind. So I plead to you all in this great hall, listen to my entire proposal and then
					tell me your own thoughts on the subject."
					<p>
					And as the crowd looked around, they quickly came to an unspoken agreement that the entire proposal would be heard without any interruption. Ulvain who asked the very question
					sat down in agreement, even leaning forward, to ensure he heard every word spoken by Har'gaz.
					<p>
					Again, Har'gaz was quiet, possibly to re-examine his speech inside himself and remove all the parts of his speech where he expected to be interrupted and then he voiced
					his entire proposal in a very clear and calm voice.
					- "As I said, this would be an empire, or perhaps resemble an empire. We would all retain our lands and ours armies, no emperor would be allowed to dictate orders to any
					king within Haman. To be specific, what I am suggesting is that all of us join in the empire and the emperor of this empire will be none of us, yet all of us. I suggest
					that this hall, the hall of Heroes be proclaimed emperor of Haman. Here we shall convene and discuss the future of the empire.
					<p>
					And I propose that in this hall, and our empire, we make our armies into one. A unified army that will defend from any invasion from any foreign threats.
					<p>
					However, we will also discuss our own internal interests, within our empire. We shall forge trade agreements and make new laws that we can all agree upon. Perhaps these laws
					will be more akin to a codex that is voluntary.
					<p>
					I believe that this idea, that began like a simple defensive plan against a great threat, has grown within me and it has sprouted leaves. I believe our empire might be this
					idea, and the leaves will be the prosperity within our own realm that will sprout from this, the unification of Haman!"
					<p>
					And with that very last proclamation, silence laid thick over the hall. Time seemed to have stopped dead in its tracks. But then, again, by some anomaly, Ulvain of all the kings
					stood up. He closed his fist, raised it and banged his chest. The great sound that arose from the impact echoed in the halls like a heavy drum of war. It symbolised the agreement
					and the same was soon clear to all in the hall. Soon that one drum sounded like an army of drums.

			Har'gaz faced great resistance at first that day, but during his proposal, after an outcry from the kings, something changed. Every king in the hall listened quietly and orderly to
			Har'gaz' proposal. On this day, he proposed an empire that had never before been seen. The very idea was unheard of. It was some kind of strange democracy, a word now well-known,
			between countries. It was a union yet also a unification. Something that was only possible due to Haman's united identity and its fear of invasion. 
			<p>
			After proposing and declaring a constitution for this new Haman, it was decided that Haman would henceforth be an empire without a ruler. Rather the council would
			often convene in the Hall of Heroes, the symbolic emperor of the empire, where they would forge agreements concerning everything from simple domestic trade to foreign trade but also
			to war plans, almost exclusively for defense. 
			<p>
			This was a bit surprising to many foreigners that already feared the Magi empire. They believed that Haman, as an empire would spread their power across the continent of Sanova and
			conquer state after state. The fear was wellfounded, as Haman had the strongest army that had possibly ever existed in all of Eldor. Not just because of that but also due to the very
			fact that several proposals of conquest was raised in the Hall of Heroes. These proposals would only appear for the first 15 or so years after its foundation. Only a single one of these
			proposals every truly gained traction, and it is also the only proposal that occured more than 20 years after the unification. This proposal was to conquer the nearby southern island of
			"undefined". This proposal nearly came to fruition with a very close vote determining that no war would be had.
			<p>
			And this was one of three main reasons that prevented the empire from conquering. 
			<p>
			
			<div class="spoiler" data-id="1"><i>(The first reason being...</i>
			<input class="wikiButtons" type="button" onclick="showSpoiler(this, 'div');" value="Show" />
			<div class="inner" style="display:none;">
				...that the army was only strong enough to be fearful as a unified empire, and therefore the army
				had to march out in unison to conquer any other kingdom. It was also an unspoken rule, that no king of Haman ever challenged, that taking their own army and marsching into a conquest would
				most likely result in them losing any protective power from the empire.
				<p>
				The second reason was that there was always a kingdom within the empire that had more to gain from trading with the would be conquest than actually conquering it, or possibly more to lose.
				<p>
				The third reason ties in neatly with the second as it was in the end more fruitful for the empire to do trade with its neighbours than it was to conquer them.
				<p>
				And the third reason is a big reason for why the Magi order started to stagnate in size. It became aparent to Haman's kings that as the Magi order expanded in the northern regions of Sanova, 
				their own empire suffered economically. This along with the fact that trade relations and minor alliances with these states became threatened and also broke down when a state eventually fell.
				This prompted Haman, as an empire, to forge a different kind of alliance with the Sanovan kingdoms than they'd done previously, name defensive alliances. Soon the influence of Haman grew
				ever stronger and their reputation as the peace keepers of northern Sanova grew.
				<p>
				These defensive alliances stopped the Magi order's desire to conquer northern Sanova ended rather abruptly. And as the Magi empire came to a halt in growth and plunder. All they could do
				was exploit the populous of their empire, and the different kings of the Magi empire started to rebel one after the other and as quickly as the Magi empire came to be strong it essentially
				broke down completely in just about 50 years, and finally, in the year 467 the Magi empire dissolved.
			</div></div><i>...)</i><p>

			Clearly the empire was indeed the solution the Haman people needed as it combined their values of honor, their huge armies and created so much joint interests both within Haman's own realm and
			their eventual foreign allies. Leading to an unpresedented period of peace, still active to this day, in the year 1428.
